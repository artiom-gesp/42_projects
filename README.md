# All my projects @school42 (by Artiom Gesp)

School 42 founded and created by the French billionaire Xavier Niel in 2013 offers a unique and revolutionary pedagogy based on projects submission instead of regular classes. 

Each student, to advance in the program, has to complete different projects grouped by themes (Algorithmic, Graphics, Shell, Cybersecurity, etc..).

To unlock the next project linked to a given theme, the previous one has to be successfully completed.

This repository contains all my projects at school 42.
Each directory features one or several projects, information about each project is given in its README file.
